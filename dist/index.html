This is accomplished by            on-page optimisation, creating high quality backlinks and other SEO            strategies, techniques and tactics. This marketing is focused on            increasing your visibility through the use of organic search            results. Effective SEO also encompasses the creation of websites            that are easier for search engines to understand. This has the happy            effect of creating websites that are easier for human beings to            understand as well. Combining ease of use for people with an            increased search engine appeal is the goal of good SEO. At Green Web            Marketing we are dedicated to fine-tuning that principle to give you            the best website possible.          </p>        </li>        <li class="faq__item">          <h3 class="highlight">            Do I have to sign a contract locking me in with your company for an            extended period?          </h3>          <p>            No. Absolutely not.

By appealing to these search            engines, websites can generate more hits and visits. Social media            sites like Facebook, Reddit and others can generate interest in your            product or service, but most users turn to search engines to find            authoritative information about their interests. No matter what            product you produce or service you provide, the bulk of your page            visits will be generated by search engines. Optimizing your website            to generate more visits will boost page visits and sales.          </p>        </li>        <li class="faq__item">          <h3 class="highlight">Do you guarantee Front Page ranking?</h3>          <p>            Although the various search engine algorithms have the final say on            where your page is ranked, we are confident enough in our process            that we do offer a guarantee on our work.

The rules that made web pages attractive to search engines five             years ago don’t have the same effect now. The basic concepts of SEO are simple and are             helpful to know whether you are a business manager or web designer. If you are willing             to learn the basics and devote time to create and maintain a SEO strategy for your             company, then you are well on your way to becoming an SEO professional.          </p>          <p>            However, depending on the results you want and the complexity of your website, SEO is a             process that is best handled by professionals. From assigning keywords to creating content,             an established company has an advantage over the most talented amateur.          </p>          <p>            GWM is more than happy to help you learn SEO. Whether you want to create and manage             your SEO on your own or use an experienced agency to aim for the front pages of Google,             having a professional and proven company on your side will help your efforts immensely.          </p>        </li>        <li class="faq__item">          <h3 class="highlight">Can I choose my own keywords?</h3>          <p>            Well, sort of.
